## Glow-based Fake Face (GFF) dataset
The CelebA dataset is a large-scale face attributes dataset with large diversities including 10,177 number of identities and more than 200K face images.
Glow is a generative flow for photo-realistic facial expression synthesis, which can change face attributes to different expressions.
In our paper, we exploit the Glow model and the CelebA face image dataset to construct the GFF dataset.
